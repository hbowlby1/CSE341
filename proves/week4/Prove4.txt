1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku): https://bowlby-cse341.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub): https://github.com/hbowlby1/CSE341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
	After finishing the videos I am now able to add items to the cart, order items from the cart, delete items from the cart and everything else from the previous videos. The only difference is that it is all connected to my MongoDB database called, "MyFirstDatabase."

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
	Everything is working as it should now.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
	Mongoose is pretty amazing in my opinion. I went through the videos for MongoDB frustrated, but as soon as I got to Mongoose, everything made sense.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
	This was a pretty challenging assignment, at least for deploying and troubleshooting to Heroku. Otherwise, there is nothing to change for this assignment.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
	4

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
	I didn't really add anything to improve on the assignment. I just really wanted to get through all the videos and learn both SQL and MongoDB.
